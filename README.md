printed in durable black v1 resin on formlabs 1+

The base ring is from the generic chinese "Magic Lock A338" - I found one on ebay for $20. Lock included.

Also check out my other design [coral v5.1](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3960285), which works with the same base ring and lock.

*pa-pin.stl* is used to optionally secure a PA ring. The tube is designed specifically to facilitate experimenting with the placement of the pin so you can emperically discover the ideal distance the PA security pin should be based on your particular anatomy.

Eventually I hope to turn this design into something of a modular chastity-tube-test-fit-kit that one can use to discover optimum dimensions based on their anatomical particulars, which then can be fed into a much sleeker parametric model that can be printed in metal.

*collar-v1.stl* and *spikering-v1.stl* are optional inserts I designed to experiment with the effects and placement of a tight "entry collar" inside the tube. They are too small and/or too long for me, but it was too much work to rebuild the main tube with a bigger inner diameter to fit larger inserts. I plan to do this in the next rev.

I used Autodesk Fusion 360 to create this design. If you would like to tweak it, please get in touch and I'll find a way to invite you to the project or export it to you.

### [older design] coralv5.1
(until I create a new repo for this earlier version, here're a few details)

in the "coral" series of designs I am exploring various PA jewelry that secures from the front, not the bottom, to make it more compatible w/ the uncut and prevent sliding motions of the tip inside the tube.

Currently the glansmitt has to be custom-sized, but it would be interesting to try making it in a flexible material, or redoing the design to support flexing or hinging or something.

I designed it in fusion360 with a combination of dimensioned modeling and direct sculpting. You can inspect/download the project files online here: https://a360.co/2WRvdsj


The tube assembly mates with the base ring from a low-cost steel device that I previously purchased on ebay. You can get one for ~$20 & it includes the lock. Search for [magic lock A338](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=Magic+Lock+A338+chastity&_sacat=0). 

I roughly modeled the based ring from the A338 when I started my design, then did my best to carefully measure and reproduce the lock plate on the ring so that the tube assembly would mate with it. (It currently has a little too much wiggle laterally - I fixed mine by shimming it with a piece of credit-card plastic and some glue).

Here's an even earlier expiriment at modelling the "glans cage":
